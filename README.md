#jupyter-apis-homework3

## What the assignment was about 😊

About working in jupyter notebook for the first time and getting information from an API.

## Something you learned in the process_ 🤷♀️

I learned how to work with API and how to extract information out of an API address. I also learned how imporant it is to pay attention to the documentation! It can save a lot of time!

## Something you found challenging👀

~~No challenges! I did the homework within five minutes!~~

It was again challenging how much work it was. Besides that it took me a while to understand the logic behind API. I didn't do the whole homework, but most of it.
